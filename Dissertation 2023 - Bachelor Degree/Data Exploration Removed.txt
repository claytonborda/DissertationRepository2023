\subsection{Data Exploration}

Data exploration is a crucial stage in our research, enabling us to comprehend the attributes, recurrent patterns and potential issues of the training dataset. Since the tweets were not equally distributed for each category, the categories was down-sampled to a uniform count of 354,501 tweets per classification in order to ensure precise model training. %1114 words

A word-frequency analysis was conducted to identify salient terms, subject matter, and unusual patterns in the data. An unusual presence of words like "amp" was found and removed accordingly. This may be occurring because of technical errors or typographical mistakes, therefore, it is essential to pre-process the data and remove such extraneous words from the data set.
