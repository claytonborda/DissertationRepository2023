The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the relationship between sentiment and changes in the league standings by describing the methodology used to conduct a comparative sentiment analysis on a football related data set. 

In terms of methodology, this study uses a mixed-methods approach to investigate the relationship between sentiment and changes in the league table. Quantitative data will be gathered through sentiment scores calculated by the three different sentiment analysis models, as well as changes in the league table. Qualitative data will be gathered through the analysis of the tweets themselves.  This mixed-methods approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between tweet sentiment and changes in the league table and match results. %==117 words
