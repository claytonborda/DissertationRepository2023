praying for 3 points tomorrow come on boys
love the passion looks an interesting buy to compete with gelhardt and greenwood
bielsa has been impressed by what he has seen
stuart dallas produced an impressive performance as leeds united sealed a 10 win over crystal palace
he was taken off as a precaution
fuck watford
loved that song
you are a snake and the worst ever player
not good enough have to be tighter at the top
shit 
bad 
worst ever
