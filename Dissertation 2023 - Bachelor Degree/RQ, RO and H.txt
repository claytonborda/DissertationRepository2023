RQ1: How do different sentiment analysis models perform using Malafosse's football-related tweet data set? 
RQ2: How do different stopword strategies (e.g., NLTK stopwords, customized stopwords, and no stopwords) impact the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in sentiment analysis football-related tasks?
RQ3: Is there a significant relationship between the sentiment of tweets related to football matches and (a) changes in the league table standings on a monthly basis and (b) match results (win, loss, or draw) on a weekly basis?
RQ4: How does the strength and direction of the relationships between tweet sentiment and football outcomes vary across different periods within a season?

Research Objectives:

To evaluate the performance of different sentiment analysis models on Malafosse's dataset and identify the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other evaluation metrics.
To investigate the impact of various stopword strategies (NLTK stopwords, customized stopwords, and no stopwords) on the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in football-related sentiment analysis tasks.
To examine the relationship between the sentiment of football-related tweets and (a) changes in the league table standings on a monthly basis, and (b) match results (win, loss, or draw) on a weekly basis.
To explore the variation in strength and direction of the relationships between tweet sentiment and football outcomes across different periods within a season.
Hypotheses:

H1: The performance of sentiment analysis models will significantly differ when applied to Malafosse's football-related tweet dataset.
H2: Different stopword strategies will have a significant impact on the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in football-related sentiment analysis tasks.
H3a: There will be a significant relationship between the sentiment of football-related tweets and changes in the league table standings on a monthly basis.
H3b: There will be a significant relationship between the sentiment of football-related tweets and match results (win, loss, or draw) on a weekly basis.
H4: The strength and direction of the relationships between tweet sentiment and football outcomes will significantly vary across different periods within a season.
