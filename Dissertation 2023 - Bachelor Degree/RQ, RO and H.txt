RQ1: How do different sentiment analysis models perform using Malafosse's football-related tweet data set? 
RQ2: How do different stopword strategies (e.g., NLTK stopwords, customized stopwords, and no stopwords) impact the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in sentiment analysis football-related tasks?
RQ3: How does the positivity rate of tweets correlate with match-winning probabilities, as assessed through Logistic Regression?
RQ4: What is the correlation between the Positive Sentiment Score and the Points Per Game (PPG) achieved by teams, and how does this relationship evolve over the course of a football season?

Research Objectives:

To evaluate the performance of different sentiment analysis models on Malafosse's dataset and identify the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other evaluation metrics.
To investigate the impact of various stopword strategies (NLTK stopwords, customized stopwords, and no stopwords) on the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in football-related sentiment analysis tasks.
To investigate the relationships between the sentiment of football-related tweets and Points Per Game (PPG) on a monthly basis, and match results (win, loss, or draw) on a weekly basis, and to determine whether there are any significant differences between these relationships.

Hypotheses:
H1: The performance of sentiment analysis models will significantly differ when applied to Malafosse's football-related tweet dataset.
H2: Different stopword strategies will have a significant impact on the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in football-related sentiment analysis tasks.
H3: There is a positive correlation between the positivity rate of tweets and the probability of match wins and high Points Per Game (PPG) for sports teams.
H4: The relationship between positive sentiment on social media, specifically Twitter, and football team performance strengthens as the season progresses, with increased positive sentiment generally corresponding to higher Points Per Game (PPG).

RQ8: How does the volume of football-related tweets change in relation to the teams
