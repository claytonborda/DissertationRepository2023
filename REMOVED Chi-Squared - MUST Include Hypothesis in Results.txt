\subsection{Chi-Squared and Hypothesis}

The Chi-Squared Test is a non-parametric statistical method that determines if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables. It compares observed frequencies (O) in a contingency table with the frequencies that would be expected (E) under the assumption of no association between the variables. A contingency table displays the frequency distribution of categorical variables in a matrix format, showing the observed frequencies of different combinations of categories of two or more variables. 

The Chi-Squared Test employs a mathematical formula to calculate the deviation between the observed and expected data, resulting in a Chi-Squared test statistic that quantifies the discrepancy between these frequencies, as follows:%3,699 words

\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(O_ij\) represents the observed frequency in each cell of the contingency table, 
    \item \(E_ij\) represents the expected frequency under the assumption of independence, and the summation (\(\sum\)) is over all cells in the table.
\end{itemize}

Another essential aspect of the Chi-Squared Test is the Degrees of Freedom (DF), which plays a critical role in determining the distribution of the test statistic and the significance of the test.  This comparison provides a critical foundation for interpreting the results of the Chi-Squared Test and evaluating the independence of categorical variables and conclude the decision to accept or reject the null hypothesis. In the context of the Chi-Squared Test, the degrees of freedom are calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
df = (r-1)(c-1)
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(r\): is the number of rows in the contingency table. 
    \item \(c\): is the columns in the contingency table. 
\end{itemize}

In scientific research, a hypothesis is a proposition put forth for consideration that a particular condition or assertion might be valid. The hypothesis is subsequently subjected to testing to determine its validity or falsity \cite{chi}. In the context of our investigation, it is noteworthy that the sentiment of tweets is deemed to be the independent variable, whereas the match outcomes constitute to the dependent variable. Accordingly, we shall formulate the subsequent Chi-Square hypothesis:

\begin{itemize}
\item Null Hypothesis (\(H0\)): There is no significant association between tweet sentiment and football outcomes (match results or league standings changes).
\item Alternative Hypothesis (\(H1\)): There is a significant association between tweet sentiment and football outcomes (match results or league standings changes).
\end{itemize}

Apart from the Chi-Square test statistic, the p-value is also a crucial component of the Chi-Squared Test. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic that is equal to or more extreme than the one calculated from the observed data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It is compared to a significance level, commonly set at 0.05, to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

In order to evaluate the validity of the null hypothesis, it is necessary to compare the calculated Chi-Square test statistic with the corresponding critical value, and also compare the derived P-value with the selected level of significance. If the computed Chi-Square test statistic exceeds the critical value, or if the P-value is below the predetermined level of significance, the null hypothesis is deemed invalid and rejected. Conversely, if the Chi-Square test statistic falls below the critical value, or if the P-value exceeds the significance level, the null hypothesis is accepted as valid.

It is important to note that while the Chi-Squared Test allows us to determine the existence of an association between the variables, it does not provide information about the strength or direction of the relationship. To assess the strength of the association, Cramers V will be used, which is a measure derived from the Chi-Squared statistic. %4,166 words

\subsection{Cramér's V}

Cramér's V is a necessary step after the Chi-Square test to determine the presence of an association to evaluate the strength of the relationship. Cramér's V is a statistic measure that ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no association between the two variables, and 1 represents a perfect association. 

Cramer's V is derived from the Chi-Squared statistic by taking the square root of the Chi-Squared value divided by the total number of observations and the minimum of the number of rows minus 1 or the number of columns minus 1. The formula for calculating Cramér's V is as follows: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:kramersv}
V=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n\min(r-1,c-1)}}
\end{equation}
Where: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item V: is the value of Cramér's V 
    \item \(\chi^2\): is the result of the Chi-Squared Test 
    \item \(n\): is the total number of observations
    \item \(r\): is the number of rows in the contingency table 
    \item \(c\): is the number of columns in the contingency table
\end{itemize}

Once Cramer's has been calculated, it can be interpreted to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between the positive and negative sentiment of tweets and match outcomes. A value of 0 indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables, while a value of 1 indicates a perfect relationship. In practice, however, values closer to 0.1 or 0.2 are more common, indicating a weak relationship, while values closer to 0.9 or 1 indicate a strong relationship. %4,346

\subsection{Choice of Chi-Squared and Cramer's V over Correlation Analysis}

Within the framework of our research, a deliberate choice was made to utilize the Chi-Squared Test and Cramers V instead of correlation analysis methods. The reasoning for this is decision is based on the categorical nature of the data under investigation. It is well-established that correlation analysis, such as Pearson or Spearman correlation, is more applicable for continuous or ordinal data. Given that our dataset comprises counts of positive and negative tweets, as well as categorical outcomes such as match results or league standings changes, the Chi-Squared Test and Cramers V are deemed to be more appropriate techniques for examining the associations between these variables.

\subsection{Application of the Statistical Model}

In order to conduct the Chi-Squared Test, a contingency table was first created for each of the two analyses (match results and standings changes), with rows representing the sentiment categories (positive or negative tweets) and columns representing the outcome categories (match results or standings changes). 
\begin{table}[H] %
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
                  & Match Won & Match Drawn & Match Lost \\
\midrule
Positive Tweets   & 45,000        & 30,000          & 25,000         \\
Negative Tweets   & 15,000        & 20,000          & 40,000         \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{A sample contingency table of tweet sentiment and match outcomes}
\label{table:contingency_table}
\end{table}
\begin{table}[H] %
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
                  & Increase & Decrease & No Change \\
\midrule
Positive Tweets   & 139,000        & 21,000       & 45,000         \\
Negative Tweets   & 24,000        & 73,000          & 64,000         \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{A sample contingency table of tweet sentiment and changes in standings}
\label{table:contingency_table}
\end{table}

The contingency table was created in Python using the pandas library, and expected frequencies were calculated assuming independence between variables. The chi2-contingency \footnote{\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html}} function from the scipy.stats library was used to find degrees of freedom and expected frequencies. The Chi-Square test statistic (X²) and its corresponding p-value were calculated, with a manual calculation performed to validate the accuracy of the code. If the p-value is below the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude a significant association between tweet sentiment and match results or league standings changes.

After determining the significance of the association using the Chi-Squared Test, Cramers V will be computed to measure the strength of the association. Through the calculation of Cramer's V, an evaluation will be conducted to discern the degree to which tweet sentiment is correlated with match outcomes or alterations in league standings. This process will facilitate comprehension not solely of the existence of an association but also of its magnitude. %4,708
